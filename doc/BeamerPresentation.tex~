 \frametitle{Introduction}

  We would like to mention some of the interesting things in our project,challenges faced and how we overcame them.

\end{frame}





\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Interesting things in our project}
These are the things which we found interesting in our project
 \begin{itemize}
 
 \item The SWAG concept implemented by us
 \item Design of W in SWAG that is introducing those wavy paths
 \item Using balloons by introducing negative gravity
 \item And finally the pressure transferring system where we used Pascal's law
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Technical Contributions}
 1. Use of Sensors for making conveyor belts
 2. Using Revolute joints for various things like motors
 3. Using Pulley joint for creating pulleys
 4. Idea of using many small balls to create a pressure-transferring system 

\end{frame}

 \frametitle{Challenges faced during the implementation}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item While trying to introduce the balloons using negative gravity they were deviating in different directions  but we need all of them to go in a direction.
 \item In the implementation of conveyor belt,we initially tried to implement the original conveyor belt where the belt moves along with the wheels but ultimately came up with a design which gives the effect of a conveyor belt.
 \item While implementing Pascal's law where we used the heavy ball to apply large force on one side,the system we prepared was very delicate.Basically it delivered food from the funnel continuously once the heavy ball fell on the plunger. This was leading to overflow of food in the bowl.
 \item In the formation of A in SWAG, the dominos were not falling in synchrony
\end{itemize}

 \frametitle{Efforts put by us to overcome them}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item While trying to introduce the balloons using negative gravity they were deviating in different directions  but we need all of them to go in a direction.
 \item In the implementation of conveyor belt,we initially tried to implement the original conveyor belt where the belt moves along with the wheels but ultimately came up with a design which gives the effect of a conveyor belt.
 \item While implementing Pascal's law we changed the design, and removed conveyor belt on the right.We changes the design of food-items 
serving plate in original project proposal. This helped us make changes in dimensions of the pressure-transferring system and the food-delivery from it started working well.
 \item In the formation of A in SWAG ,we had to change the densities of individual dominos, adjust the impulse given by block to leftmost domino by adjusting the horizontal speed of 'conveyor', and so on. Almost all these things required hundreds of simulations again and again,
changing one property at a time.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Conclusion}
 We have used a lot of concepts learnt in our labs.Some of them are
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Box2D simulation of our lab03.
 \item Makefiles
 \item Inkscape
 \item Using Doxygen for documentation
 \item Latex and presentions in beamer which are useful for presenting the work neatly
 \item Profiling using gprof.
\end{itemize}
