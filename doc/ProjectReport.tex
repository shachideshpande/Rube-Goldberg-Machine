\section{What is our project?}
We made a Rube GoldBerg Machine using Box2D,a 2D rigid body simulation library.We named it {\bf {The SWAG Machine}}.We named it so because ultimatly after simulation the word SWAG appers on the screen.In addition to this it provides food and drinks for the human sitting below.  \\ \\
\section{Our original project idea!}
In our project we were going to use dominos,pulley system,balloons,pendulums,planks,balls,containers,funnel,conveyor belts,motor system,human design,pascals system(which follows pascals law)..etc as major components in our project.Ultimately our major goal is to provide food and drinks for the human and the word SWAG to appear finally in the simulation.\\
 Initially there exists a pendulum oscillatinng in the left-top which triggers the movement of dominos on the left and a ball on the right.\\
 On the left side the movement of a domino triggers the movement of all other dominos on the first plank and the last domino on the plank is hinged to it.Similarly this last domino triggers the other dominos on the second plank and ultimately leading to the formation of S.And the movement of the block on the third plank is triggered by the last domino on the third plank.This falls on the conveyor belt below and sensors are used to detect the collision between the block and conveyor belt and give it a force towards right.This block hits the ball which in turn hits the domino on its right and the movement of dominos ultimately leading to the formation of half part of A.\\ \\
 On the right side when the bob of pendulum hits the ball the ball bounces two times on the two horizontal planks in W and after final bounce it goes through passage in D and hits the block.This block falls on the rotating motor and ultimately the block falls in the conveyor belt whose movement leads to the formation of another half part of A as described above.\\
 This completes the SWAG formation.\\ 
 Coming to the food and drinks to be provided to the human,this implementation starts below the SWAG.The balls in the left most container below SWAG leak through the gap and through the passage they go into the right container of the pulley system.While this right container is moving up it hits the plank on its right and with the movement of hot air balloons this moves and triggers the movement of plank on which drinks are placed.This completes providing drinks to the human.\\ 
 On the right side below the SWAG a heavy ball near G is triggered by the rotating motor which passes through the funnel and this heavy ball pushes the food in the right container and using the conclusions of Pascal's law the food comes out from the passage in the left container and ultimately goes into the bowl near human.This completes the total implementation.\\

\section{Changes}
Our final implementation had few changes as opposed to original project design.The changes made were as follows:\\
1. We excluded the right conveyor belt, and worked with only the left conveyor belt.\\
2. We made the 'G' letter from straight segments and not curved ones as in the original idea.\\
3. We changed the food-delivery system for the man on his left side by putting food into pan of pulley instead of making a table for that. \\
\newpage
\section{Difficulties faced and solutions devised}
We changed some parts of design due to physical constraints on motion of few objects.\\
We did not add the conveyor to right since it was very difficult to make the block on stem of G fall on it.\\
Also, due to shortage of space in the actual frame, we removed the food table on right of man, and changed that to food delivery system by a pulley joint.
Due to space constraints, we also changed the position of the assembly delivering food to man.\\
Also, we changed the curved design of G to straight segments, since implementation of curved parts was not very good to look in 
the final simulation.\\
We had a lot of problems in implementing sensors. We read a lot about sensors and collectively implemented it finally, using iforce2d tutorials for reference.
\\
While implementing Pascal's law we changed the design, and removed conveyor belt on the right.We changes the design of food-items 
serving plate in original project proposal. This helped us make changes in dimensions of the pressure-transferring system and the food-delivery from it started working well.\\
We had many problems in executing the A letter part in the simulation. We had to make hundreds of simulations to make the dominos on the 
sequential blocks fall in synchrony.In the formation of A in SWAG ,we had to change the densities of individual dominos, adjust the impulse given by block to leftmost domino by adjusting the horizontal speed of 'conveyor', and so on. Almost all these things required hundreds of simulations again and again,
changing one property at a time.\\

\section{New Things Learnt}
We learnt following things from this lab:\\
1. Implementation of revolute joints\\
 	Revolute joints can be used in a variety of ways. They can be used to hold 2 objects, and we can define the amount of allowed rotation. We can define the points on the 2 bodies along which we want to see the rotation happening. The most wonderful thing about it is that it can be used to create motors.\\
2. Adding custom motors using revolute joints\\
 We can define specific maximum torque and angular speed for motors. These motors can be helpful to generate required impulses in the simulation.\\
3. Adding sensors:\\
	Sensors can be added by initially defining the required fixtures' isSensor value as true.Now we have to define a new sensor, overriding the BeginContact and EndContact functions in the class extending contactListener. This helps us to define the action to 
be taken when sensors come into contact. This was the key feature we used in making conveyor belt.\\
\newpage
\section{Profiling}
We used gprof tool to profile the code. We have the following observations for the same.
These are the top 3 functions who consume more time.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ ||c c c c|| } 
 \hline      
time & seconds & seconds & calls Ts/call Ts/call name  \\
40.35 & 0.23 & 0.23 & b2World::SolveTOI() \\
21.05 & 0.35 & 0.12 & b2ContactManager::AddPair() \\
14.04 & 0.43 & 0.08 & b2World::Solve() \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
 
In the original base code, such top 3 functions consuming most of the time were as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ ||c c c c|| } 
 \hline      
time & seconds & seconds & calls Ts/call Ts/call name  \\
10.71 & 0.03 & 0.03 & operator*() \\
7.14 &  0.05 & 0.02 & b2Dot() \\
7.14 & 0.07 & 0.02 & b2Vec2::b2Vec2() \\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}




Since we implemented sensors in our project, more time was spent in functions related to that, like SolveTOI and b2ContactManager:: AddPair().
The efficiency of various functions did not change much after making specific changes after looking at above profiling data.
